  <h2>3D Realistic Architecture</h2>
  <p>
      The <strong>REALISTIC 3D ARCHITECTURE DESIGN FOR CONSTRUCTING BUILDING</strong> is an online platform that connects architects, civil engineers, 3D designers, and contractors.
      Users can register, search for professionals based on location, rating, and experience, and request building elevations.
      Architects provide blueprints, which can be converted to 3D designs if desired. Users can then request project cost estimates from contractors.
      All communications and contracts are secured with encryption, and users can rate architects based on their work.

  <h2>Two Factor Data Security Mechanism</h2>
  <p>
      <strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA)</strong> enhances data security by requiring users to provide two different authentication factors before gaining access to a system or account.
      Typically, these factors are something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a smartphone or hardware token).
      This adds an extra layer of security, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access sensitive information even if they have obtained the password through phishing or other means.
